# Kernel-Exploits
these are several kernel exploits that are based on unchecked IOCTL requests sent to signed drivers. most of these work correctly but did not match my current use case (main project) but i still wanted to record it as its a big part from learning reversing and kernel exploits for me.
exploited modules-
dbutil_2_3.sys - arbitrary read/write, allocating contiguous memory pool (didnt really go deep on the last exploit)
BS_Flash64.sys - allocation/Freeing of PAGE_SIZE (0x1000) sized kernel pools
AHL.sys - Allocation of a non paged pool the size of 0xA00000


STARTING THE EXPLOITS:
1. extract Addfolders.zip in this specific path: "C:\nosusfolder", KMDFdriver does not have to be there but the others do
2. start exploiting
# main() is still set up as i imagined for it to work with my driver mapper, so change anything accordingly and see uses i do to understand functions
